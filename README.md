# Where to next ? - A Recommendation System

## Introduction
In recent years, the use of systems that can make personalized recommendations using user data and
purchase/visit history has increased significantly. Everyday millions of searches are made on Google,
with a bulk of the searches attributed to look for reviews before visiting a particular place.
User preference, Item popularity and User stringency while giving ratings vary over time, which
adds to the complication of suggesting places. Traditional recommendation systems use collaborative
and content-based methods, but do not incorporate time information. Hence, we have used variants
of collaborative filtering methods to capture the temporal effects while making recommendations.
This enables the system to make personalized recommendations. In addition to this, we have made a
hybrid recommendation system to combine the recommendations from these individual models.
