# Where to next ? - A Recommendation System

![Where to next poster](imgs/Poster_Final.pdf)

## Introduction
In recent years, the use of systems that can make personalized recommendations using user data and
purchase/visit history has increased significantly. Everyday millions of searches are made on Google,
with a bulk of the searches attributed to look for reviews before visiting a particular place.
User preference, Item popularity and User stringency while giving ratings vary over time, which
adds to the complication of suggesting places. 
Traditional recommendation systems use collaborative
and content-based methods, but do not incorporate time information. Hence, we have used variants
of collaborative filtering methods to capture the temporal effects while making recommendations.
This enables the system to make personalized recommendations.

## Data
The dataset contains reviews about businesses from Google Local (Google Maps). Data includes
geographic information for each business as well as the reviews.

Size of the Dataset :
1. 11,453,845 Reviews 
2. 4,567,431 Users 
3. 3,116,785 Businesses 

## Recommender Systems

We implemented the following different types of the recommendation models:
1. Neighbourhood Model (User-User collaborative filtering)
2. Latent-Factor Model
3. Content-Based Model
